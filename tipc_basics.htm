TIPC overview , Motivation and Assumptions
TIPC (Transparent IPC) was developed by Ericsson and version 2.0 is opensource.

Motivation of developing this protocol was to develop a fast inter-process communication across different nodes of cluster in a network .

This protocol achieves this by handing over packet from layer 2 to application layer directly , hence doesn ot have any overhead of packet going through the normal networking stack.

This protocol works under the assumption that it would be used in a closed environment and hence it assumes the network being secure.

Since it bypasses whole of the network stack, it has its own mechanism of identifying individual nodes of a cluster.This is based on a unique addressing scheme <Z.C.N:port> .Associated with each node is a unique identifier called Network Identifier.

Max Zones: 1 - 255 (8 bit)

Max clusters: 1- 4095 (12 bit)

Max Nodes: 1 - 4095 (12 bit)

TIPC can be connection oriented and connection less depending on the option selected by the programmer.

TIPC is a message based protocol and size of the message ranges from 1-66000 bytes.

There would  be a unique address and network identifier associated with a node, irrespective of the number of interfaces on a node.
