Memory mapping: Mapping of device memory directly into user process addrs space.
Direct memory access(DMA) provides device the direct access to memory without cpu intervention.

Addresses:
<u>Physical address:</u>
Corresponds to the actual address provided by RAM.
<u>Bus address:</u>
Can be same as physical address but in some cases there is an IOMMU involved which translates the scattered address into contiguous address.
<u>Kernel logical address:</u>
Same as physical address but is at some offset from the physical address.Kmalloc returns logical address.
<u>Virtual address:</u>
Virtual address may or may not be mapped to physical address.eg address returned by vmalloc and kmap.
All logical address are virtual addresses but all virtual addresses may not be virtual addresses.

_pa() macro is used to convert logical address into physical address
_va() macro physical address is mapped back to virtual address only for high memory regions.
