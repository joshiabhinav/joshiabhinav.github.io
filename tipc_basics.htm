      TIPC overview , Motivation and Assumptions</h3>
    
TIPC (Transparent IPC) was developed by Ericsson and version 2.0 is opensource.<br>
1) Motivation of developing this protocol was to develop a fast inter-process communication 
across different nodes of cluster in a network .<br>
2) This protocol achieves this by handing over packet from layer 2 to application layer directly , 
    hence doesn ot have any overhead of packet going through the normal networking stack.This protocol works under the 
    assumption that it would be used in a closed environment and hence it assumes the network being secure.<br>
3) Since it bypasses whole of the network stack, it has its own mechanism of identifying individual nodes of a cluster.
    This is based on a unique addressing scheme <Z.C.N:port> .Associated with each node is a unique identifier called Network Identifier.<br>
4) Max Zones: 1 - 255 (8 bit)<br>
   Max clusters: 1- 4095 (12 bit)<br>
   Max Nodes: 1 - 4095 (12 bit)<br>
5) TIPC can be connection oriented and connection less depending on the option selected by the programmer.<br>
6) TIPC is a message based protocol and size of the message ranges from 1-66000 bytes.<br>
7) There would  be a unique address and network identifier associated with a node, irrespective of the number of interfaces on a node.<br>
