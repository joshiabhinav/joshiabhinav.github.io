IKE(Internet key exchange) is a group of protocol namely.
1) ISAKMP
2) SKEME
3) OAKLEY

ISAKMP: Provides messaging and message formats.
OAKLEY: Provides key exchange modes for diffie hellman key exchange.
SKEME: Provides features like key replacement, forward security, repudability,

The overall mechanism of key exchange is borrowed heavily from ISAKMP and like ISAKMP it consists of 2 phases.
1) Main mode and Aggressive mode
2) Quick mode.

During phase1 it authenticate, establish secure channel and exchange keys for SA.
During phase2 Ipsec SA are created and used for data transfer.

Main mode:( 6 messages are exchanged )
          -------HDR-SA-------->
          <------HDR-SA---------
          ----HDR-KEY-NONCE---->
Initiator <---HDR-KEY-NONCE-----   Responder
          ----HDR-ID-AUTH------>
          <---HDR-ID-AUTH-------

Aggressive mode:( 3 messages are exchanged )
          -------HDR-SA-key-ID-nonce-------->
Initiator <------HDR-SA-key-ID-nonce-AUTH---- Responder
          ---------HDR-ID-AUTH-------------->
In first message SA header ,Initiator offers proposals and transforms to choose from.
Responder responds with selected proposals and transforms chosen.
Phase 1 can use any of the following
1) Shared secret
2) Digital Signature
3) Public key authentication
4) New Public key authentcation
