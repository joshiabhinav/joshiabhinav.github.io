1) VLan tagging

3) Vlan mapping rules
4) Frame distribution
</h2>
<pre>
A device can be called VLAN aware even if it doesnot add, delete or modifies tags but forwards frames on the basis of
certain rules.
In a network edge switch can add tags to untagged frames or forward is as such.

Forwarding is done by two means->
- Parse the packet and apply VLAN rules
- Apply VLAN tags to the frame.

VLan Tagging:

Two types
i) Implicit tagging:
- Forwarding is done by VLan aware devices on the basis of
    i) Destination datalink address
    ii) Protocol ID
    iii) Higher layer protocol
    iii) Application specific fields 

ii) Explicit tagging

destination address | source address |vlan protocl ID| Tag control Info(Priority/|CFI=0|vlan identifier|Lenght/type)/~data(46-1500bytes)~/FCS
