<h2>UNIQUE_PTR:<br></h2>
<p>
This replaces the concept of auto_ptr in legacy CPP.<br>
The pointer is automatically removed when it is out of scope of the code block.<br>
The idea of unique pointer is to have single ownerer ship which means it cannot be passed around or copied, for that there is something called shared_ptr.<br>
Players involved:<br>
- unique_ptr<br>
- make_unique<br>
Unique pointer can be integrated with legacy code or even code written in C(say some library), once registered the unique_ptr will take care of the deallocation of the resource.This can be <br>
achieved by implementing a custom destructor which is passed as the second argument to the pointer itself, this option is optional, meaning if there is no need to do say custom<br>
deletion and rely on deallocator provided by the cpp framework, second argument can be ignored.<br>
